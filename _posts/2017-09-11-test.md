So here we go, first blog post of a new site I'm creating <a href="http://www.bookin.today">bookin.today</a>

The idea is to introduce mobile-first web apps to the military community to make their lives easier. The British Armed Services, together with our National Health Service are seriously behind when it comes to technology. The NHS thankfully does have a number of leading startups who are aiming to help them (<a href="http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/digital-doldrums-nhs-remains-worlds-largest-purchaser-of-fax-machines">read this hilarious report by Deep Mind Health on the NHS being the world's largest purchaser of fax machines</a>)

Despite military spending in the UK reaching $48.3bn in 2017, there is scant all effort to embrace digital technology to improve efficiency. A lot of this is understandable due to obvious security implications but that cannot be an excuse for all cases.

I'm attempting to solve one such problem. In the Services, people of various ranks live and eat in what's called a Mess. Most meals are taken here and they primarily rely on a paper and pen solution of booking into meals. This becomes a problem when the messes are typically a good 15 minute walk from the main area of work, no sign in? no meal for you.

The result is that people miss meals or people sign in for all of them and the chefs produce a lot of wasted food. The solution could be so simple if a simple web app was created. So that's what I'm doing.

This sounds trivial, and it to some extent it is. But we have to start from somewhere and it doesn't look like anyone else is doing it. My hope is that we can identify future non security-sensitive tools that could be introduced onto the site from people management to other burdensome admin tasks.

Let's wait and see!
